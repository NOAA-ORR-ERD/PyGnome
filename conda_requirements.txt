# Documents the conda packages required for PyGnome
#
#  This should be the minimal conda install to run PyGNOME
#  See:
#    conda_requirements_build.txt for build requirements
#    conda_requirements_test for testing requirements
#    conda_requirements_docs.txt requirements for building the sphinx docs

#  install with:
#    conda install --file conda_requirements.txt
#
#  or create an environmemnt:
#    conda create -n gnome python=3.9 --file conda_requirements.txt
#   (python version is not specified in the conda_requirements file)
# if you want a full development environment,
# you can install the whole thing at once:
#
# conda create -n gnome python=3.9 --file conda_requirements.txt --file conda_requirements_build.txt --file conda_requirements_test.txt --file conda_requirements_docs.txt


# These packages should all be in one of the following channels:
# defaults
# conda-forge

# it'll probably work with 3.8, but CI is teseting with 3.9.
