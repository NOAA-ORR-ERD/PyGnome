        simply returned
    :param time_step: step size for the simulation in seconds.
    :param persistence: in seconds. Since we add randomness for each timestep,
        the persistence parameter is used to make the randomness invariant to
        size of time_step. Default is None. If persistence is None, it gets set
        equal to 'time_step'. If persistence < 0 for any elements, their values
        are not updated in the 'array'
