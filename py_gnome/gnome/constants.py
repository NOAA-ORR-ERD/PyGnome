'''
Constants are mostly used internally. They are all documented here to keep them
in one place. The 'units' serve as documentation **do not mess with them**.
There is no unit conversion when using these constants - they are used as is
in the code, implicitly assuming the units are SI and untouched.

ToDo:
 - add a few comments saying what these are, and fill in the rest of the units
 - update with more meaningful names
