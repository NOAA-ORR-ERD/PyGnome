Introduction
############

PyGNOME is general Lagrangian Element (particle tracking) code written primarily in Python, with some bindings to C++ code for certain functionality. It is the core engine of the General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) Suite of tools.

It is used by NOAA as the engine behind |webgnome| -- a publicly available Web-based interface customized for oil spill modeling.

PyGNOME can be used to write scripts for oil spill and general transport applications.

PyGNOME is a flexible framework that can be customized with alternative algorithms for oil fate and transport processes, or virtually any oceanic transport application. It includes a full set of algorithms to support oil spill modeling, but is also used for a variety of applications, including soluble chemicals in water, tracking of marine debris, Larvae transport, etc.

History
-------

GNOME began development in the late 1990s, as the successor to NOAA's original oil spill model, the On Scene Spill Model (OSSM).
It was built using an object oriented approach, written in C++ , with a dual platform GUI, originally for Windows32 and MacOS.

The latest version is written in Python with new code, as well as wrappers around much of the same computational code used in the desktop GUI version.
The current version is written in a combination of Python, Cython and C++.

In addition to the transport code, updated versions of oil weathering algorithms were brought in from the ADIOS2 desktop GUI Application, written in C++
